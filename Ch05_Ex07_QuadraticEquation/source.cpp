/* @brief Assignment from chapter 5 exercise 7.
 * Book: Programming Principle and Practice using C++ (Second Edition) - Stroustrup
 *
 * Quadratic equations are of the form
 * a*(x^2) + b*x + c = 0
 * To solve these, one uses the quadratic formula:
 * x_1, x_2 = (-b -+ sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / (2*a)
 *
 * There is a problem, though: if b2â€“4ac is less than zero, then it will fail.
 * Write a program that can calculate x for a quadratic equation. Create a
 * function that prints out the roots of a quadratic equation, given a, b, c.
 * When the program detects an equation with no real roots, have it print
 * out a message. How do you know that your results are plausible? Can
 * you check that they are correct?
