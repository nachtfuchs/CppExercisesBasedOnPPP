# Article "the"
An article comes with a noun. It would be not practical to add the article "the" in front of every noun. 
Besides, there are more articles than "the", e.g. "a", "an". This means that a new category "Article" needs
to be defined in the grammar. It needs to be linked to the other categories, and the question arises to which one?
Obviously, it cannot be a noun, because e.g. "the" "birds" is not a noun, but it could be a sentence in the given
grammar. Think of the following dialogue:
Lady: "What is that beautiful sound?"
Gentleman: "The birds." :-)
