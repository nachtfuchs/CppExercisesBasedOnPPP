# Thoughts on the assignment
Questions that rise in my head:
- Why should the assignment be repeated?
- How is this assignment linked to the current chapter? (This is hard to answer, because I read the chapter months ago.)
- What should I learn from this assignment?

## The thoughts
I think that the assignment is good because of the following reasons:
1. It gives the chance to refactor the code written in the past.
2. It shows that code can be easily used as a starting point.
3. It gives the chance to think about the older problem with more knowledge from chapter 6, and allows more thinking and tinkering on the design and architectural part of the assignment. The thoughts do not necessarily need to be molded in code for such a "small assignment". They can stay as thoughts :-)
