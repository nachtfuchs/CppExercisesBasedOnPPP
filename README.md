# CppExercisesBasedOnPPP
Solved Cpp exercises based on Bjarne Stroustrup's book "Programming Principle and Practice using Cpp" (2nd edition)

## Focus of this repository
I am learning C++ based on Stroustrup's book. The book is a great resource to learn C++ for beginners,
because it explains concepts and challenges the student to work on assignments and consolidate knowledge.

The focus is to write correct, maintainable and readable solutions to the assignments.
